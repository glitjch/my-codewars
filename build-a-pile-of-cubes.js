/**
 * Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.

You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?

The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb, ...) will be an integer m and you have to return the integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.

Examples:
findNb(1071225) --> 45

findNb(91716553919377) --> -1

function findNb(m) {
  let max = m;
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= max; i++) {
    max -= i**3;
    count++;
  }
  return max ? -1 : count - 1
}

findNb(24723578342962);
